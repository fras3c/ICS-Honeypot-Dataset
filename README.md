# ICS Honeypot Interactions: A Latitudinal Study (Dataset)
Welcome to the "ICS-Honeypot-Dataset". Our dataset consists of both IT and ICS interactions gathered over a three-month period from our HoneyICS deployment, actively exposed to the internet.

## Overview

This repository contains the dataset and associated Jupyter notebook for the paper titled "ICS Honeypot Interactions: A Latitudinal Study." The paper investigates the proliferation of sophisticated threats targeting Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) and presents a latitudinal study on a dataset collected from an ICS honeynet. The honeynet emulates ICS devices exposed on the Internet, providing insights into the level of interaction, origin of interactions, and interaction/attack patterns.
